Title: Virtual Connect Four

Description: 

The classic Connect Four game is now available on the web. The same two player game with the same look and feel as the classic game.  The game involves two players that alternate turns until the game is won.  The object of the game is for a player to connect four game pieces in a row either hroizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Gravity will be present on the screen to present the same feel as the original game. The user selects "clicks" the column they wish to drop the piece and the piece will drop to the correct slot 

Minimal Viable Product Goals:
    - Display Board
    - Switch user function
    - Display arrow icons on for columns to drop game piece
    - Have some kind of display for the game piece dropping 
    - Have winning functionality with message

Post-MVP Goals:
    - Add a different shaped board (user chooses between normal and non-normal shape)
    - Add additonal boundaries/barriers to make game more interesting
