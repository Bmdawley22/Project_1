Title: Ultimate Connect Four

Description: 

The classic Connect Four game with a twist. Still the same two player game with the same goal (connect four game pieces in a row).  However, in Ultimate Connect Four, users will be able to choose various game board shapes with various barriers within the board along with the number of slots  to add to the strategy. Gravity will be present on the screen to present the same feel as the original game.

Minimal Viable Product Goals:
    - Display Board
    - Switch user function
    - Display arrow icons on for columns to drop game piece
    - Have some kind of display for the game piece dropping 
    - Have winning functionality with message

Post-MVP Goals:
    - Add a different shaped board (user chooses between normal and non-normal shape)
    - Add additonal boundaries/barriers to make game more interesting
